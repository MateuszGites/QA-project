# QA-project

### Why are we doing this? 
This project is my finnal pass project for the bootcamp. I'm doing it so QA can check my skills and mark me for my progress in codding.

### How I expected the challenge to go. 
I expected to have some smaller issues with creating my first app fully working, but wasn't affraid to push my limits.

### What went well? / What didn't go as planned? 
I have succesfully created app but had some issues with GitHub Repository. It took me few days to resolve merging issues.

### Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. 
Create more Entities, persissting database and more features!
