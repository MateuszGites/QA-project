# QA-project

### Why are we doing this? 


### How I expected the challenge to go. 
I expected to have some smaller issues with creating my first app fully working, but wasn't affraid to push my limits.
### What went well? / What didn't go as planned? 
I have succesfully created app but had some issues with GitHub Repository. It took me few days to resolve merging issues.
### Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
